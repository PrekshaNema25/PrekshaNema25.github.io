# About Me
<div style = "text-align: justify"> I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. under Dr. Mitesh M. Khapra and co-guided by Dr. Balaraman Ravindran at IIT Madras. I joined IIT Madras as an M.Tech in July 2015, and then converted to Ph.D. programme in March 2017. My area of research is Deep learning for NLP. Currently my work is focussed on modelling better attention mechanism techniques for different Natural Language Generation tasks.

        <div style = "text-align: justify"> <h6>  The task of Reading Comprehension with Multiple Choice Questions, requires a human (or machine) to read a given *{passage, question}* pair and select one of the *n* given options. The current state of the art model for this task first computes a query-aware representation for the passage and then *selects* the option which has the maximum similarity with this representation. However, when humans perform this task they do not just focus on option selection but use a combination of *elimination* and *selection*. This process could be repeated multiple times till the reader is finally ready to select the correct option. We propose *ElimiNet*, a neural network based model which tries to mimic this process. Specifically, it has gates which decide whether an option can be eliminated given the {*passage, question*} pair and if so it tries to make the passage representation orthogonal to this eliminated option (akin to ignoring portions of the passage corresponding to the eliminated option). The model makes multiple rounds of partial elimination to refine the passage representation and finally uses a selection module to pick the best option. </h6></div></td></tr>
