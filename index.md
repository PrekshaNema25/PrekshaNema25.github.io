# About Me
<div style = "text-align: justify"> I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. under Dr. Mitesh M. Khapra and co-guided by Dr. Balaraman Ravindran at IIT Madras. I joined as an M.Tech in 2015, but recently converted to Ph.D. I work on Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing. </div>

* [Diversity driven Attention Model for Query-based Abstractive Summarization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.08300)
  * <div style="text-align: center" > Abstract: *Abstractive summarization aims to generate a shorter version of the document covering all the salient points in a compact and coherent fashion. On the other hand, query-based summarization highlights those points that are relevant in the context of a given query. The encode-attend-decode paradigm has achieved notable success in machine translation, extractive summarization, dialog systems, etc. But it suffers from the drawback of generation of repeated phrases. In this work we propose a model for the query-based summarization task based on the encode-attend-decode paradigm with two key additions (i) a query attention model (in addition to document attention model) which learns to focus on different portions of the query at different time steps (instead of using a static representation for the query) and (ii) a new diversity based attention model which aims to alleviate the problem of repeating phrases in the summary. In order to enable the testing of this model we introduce a new query-based summarization dataset building on debatepedia. Our experiments show that with these two additions the proposed model clearly outperforms vanilla encode-attend-decode models with a gain of 28 (absolute) in ROUGE-L scores.* </div>
